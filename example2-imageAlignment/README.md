- We have two images. One is the **reference image**, the other is the **scanned image**. For example, below left is a **reference image** and below right is the **scanned image**.

    <img src="https://github.com/Zju-George/ComputerVisionExamples/raw/main/example2-imageAlignment/assets/scan.jpg" width="400"/>
